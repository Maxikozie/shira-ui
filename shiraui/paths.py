"""Filesystem locations owned by the app.

The work directory matters more than it looks. shiradl calls
``dl.cleanup()`` -> ``shutil.rmtree(temp_path)`` in a ``finally`` after *every*
track (shiradl/dl.py:261, shiradl/cli.py). Whatever path is handed to
``--temp-path`` is therefore recursively deleted, repeatedly, without
confirmation.

The old GUI exposed that as a free-text Browse field next to the destination
field, so pointing it at Desktop would have destroyed Desktop.

Here the app always appends its own uniquely-named leaf, and the user can
never type the path. The worst possible rmtree target is a directory this
process created seconds earlier containing only its own partial downloads --
the blast radius is structurally zero rather than merely validated.
